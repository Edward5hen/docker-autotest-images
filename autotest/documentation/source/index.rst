Autotest Documentation
======================

Autotest is a framework for fully automated testing. It is designed
primarily to test the Linux kernel, though it is useful for many other
purposes such as qualifying new hardware, virtualization testing and
other general user space program testing under linux platforms. It's an
open-source project under the GPL and is used and developed by a number
of organizations, including Google, IBM, Red Hat, and many others.

Please check Avocado, a next generation test automation framework being
developed by several of the original Autotest team members:
